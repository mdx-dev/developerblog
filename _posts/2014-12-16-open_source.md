You've used open source software. We all have. Projects like [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt), [Mongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) and [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) have been used by millions. It's time for us to give a little back.

## Why Contribute

Besides all of us using these open source projects, there are still plenty of reasons why you should consider giving back to the community. When you contribute you can learn new things, know how to use the open source software better, and get to know the amazing people who helped create it. You also get the warm fuzzy feeling knowing you helped other users. Lastly, it looks great on your Github profile!

## Finding Causes

While trying to convince others to contribute, the biggest excuse I hear is that they don't know what to contribute to. There are lots of projects designed to help you do just that.

### Websites

#### Github

The most obvious choice, [Github's Explore](https://github.com/explore) is almost always overlooked. This section breaks projects down by language and type of project, like Game Engines or NoSQL Databases.

#### 24 Pull Requests

The website [24 Pull Requests](http://24pullrequests.com/projects) is designed to get you making pull requests all the days in December before Christmas, this handy website provides hundreds of projects already looking for help. They give you a beautiful interface for selecting the languages you want and displaying potential projects for you.

#### Local Meetups

You can find lots of [local meetups](http://www.meetup.com/) online that are eagerly seeking help.

#### Your favorite organizations

You already have organizations you enjoy, why not give back to them? Software you use is the easiest to contribute to since you know how to use it, set it up, and how you'd change it already.

#### Other Mentions

[Code Montage](https://www.codemontage.com/) - Empowers coders to improve their impact on the world.
[Code Triage](http://www.codetriage.com/) - Help your favorite open source projects.

### Where to begin

Now that you have a project, we need to find something good to be added.

* Browse open issues on Github
* Find dead Pull Requests and finish them
* Add (Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) Integration
* Add or Fix Documentation, everybody will love you
* Add code style fixes
* Convert all their JavaScript to [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), everybody will hate you

### Need Help?

If you are needing help reach out to others maintaining the project. You can view their Github profile to get their contact information, view their project website, or even their [Gitter Room](https://gitter.im). If you are willing to help, they are willing to work with you.
